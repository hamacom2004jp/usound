Reference: Procedure for building a Windows environment for Redis
====================================================================

- `usound` uses Redis.

    1. Download the installer from `GitHub <https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases>`__ .
    2. Run the downloaded installer (MSI file).
    3. The wizard will ask you to set the installation directory, so please make a note of the path you set. The default is `C:\\Program Files\\Redis` .
    4. In the wizard, there is a setting for the service port of the Redis server, so please make a note of the port you set. The default is 6379.
    5. There is a setting in the wizard for the maximum amount of memory to be used, so set it as needed. For development use, about 100 mb is sufficient. 
    6. After installation is complete, open the installation directory in Explorer.
    7. Open the `redis.windows-service.conf` and `redis.windows-service.conf` files in it with a text editor such as Notepad.
    8. In this file, search for `requirepass foobared`, remove the `#` and uncomment it out.
    9. Change the `foobared` part of `requirepass foobared` to your desired password. Make a note of the changed password.
    10. This password will be the password specified in the `usound` command.
    11. Open the Windows Task Manager, open the Services tab, right-click `Redis`, and restart the service.
